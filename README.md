# Refactoring Horiseon Webpage

## Description

This project was to refactor an existing website to better the Search Engine Optimization and Website Accesibility. In order to help Horiseon appear higher in search engines I refactored the semenatics to give a better description of what the HTML content was regarding. Some examples of semantic changes made were:
~ <nav> tags to represent the Navigation bar.
~ <header> tags to represent the Header of the site.
~ <main>  tags to represent the main content of the website
~ <aside> tags to represent the right floating side bar.

In order to help make the website better for website accesibility I added alternative text to images and gave certain sections of HTML titles. 

The CSS was also refactored with comments to help section the code for easier reading and editing. Certain classes were also consolidated to just one grouping off selectors in order to eliminate the need for repeating the same block of CSS styling.

I learned the importance of using the correct semantics and organizing code so it can be easily read and edited. I also learned the importance of adding titles and alternative text to help with SEO scores and website accesibilty for the visually impaired.
